HDFC Securities has downgraded Eicher Motors from ‘add’ to ‘reduce’ rating, and reduced its target price to Rs 3,086 per share from Rs 3,715.   Written by Meghna Sinha  July 7, 2023 00:30 IST

Eicher Motors’ stock price slipped nearly 3% on Thursday, and nearly 11% in three trading sessions, amid a significant increase in competition. Share prices of Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp, meanwhile, hit their 52-week high of Rs 4,936.70 and Rs 3,206.15, respectively, on BSE.
On Wednesday, Bajaj Auto and Triumph Motorcycles rolled out Triumph Speed 400 with a price tag of Rs 2.23 lakh. This followed Hero MotoCorp and Harley Davidson’s launch of the X440 on Monday. Priced at Rs 2.29 lakh, the X440 is the first among a series slated to be launched in the middle weight (250cc and 800cc) segment.

HDFC Securities has downgraded Eicher Motors from ‘add’ to ‘reduce’ rating, and reduced its target price to Rs 3,086 per share from Rs 3,715. The brokerage said significant increase in competitive intensity has changed the business dynamics unfavourably Royal Enfield.
“While HD440X pricing took us by surprise, that of the Triumph 400cc came in as a bigger surprise, given that it comes with superior features like a liquid-cooled engine, upside-down forks, ride-by-wire, torque assist clutch, etc. We believe both these prices are likely to be introductory as both these brands try to gain a foothold in the cruiser market in India, which is currently dominated by RE (Royal Enfield)”, said the report.
HDFC Securities has lowered its earnings estimates by 16-18% over FY24-25E and expects Royal Enfield to be in a much better position to fight back once the competitive pricing stabilises. However, the brokerage firm underscored that if these competitive price points sustain for longer than expected, there would be further downside risks to its estimates.
According to Ruchit Jain of 5paisa.com, Eicher’s Royal Enfield enjoys a monopoly in the market. With these new entrants, there’s uncertainty among market participants whether Eicher will continue to command premium valuation.
He added that selling volume of Eicher’s stock in the cash segment is significantly higher than the regular sessions, indicating its underperformance. “Eicher Motors is likely to remain under pressure in near term and the support range lies between 3,000 and 3,100,” he said.

Bajaj Auto, meanwhile, has and ‘overweight’ rating from Morgan Stanley, while CLSA maintained an ‘outperform’ rating for the automaker. Jefferies gave a ‘buy’ rating, stating that with the launch of the attractively priced Triumph, it expects Bajaj Auto’s volume & EPS to grow at a 15% & 23% CAGR, respectively, over FY23-25E.
Share prices of Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp closed up 0.59% and 0.47%, respectively, on Thursday. Eicher Motors closed at Rs 3,222.60, down 2.63%.

Satin Creditcare aims at Rs 1,000-crore MSME book
Satin Creditcare had a consolidated assets under management of Rs 9,115 crore as on March 31 and expects to grow its overall loan book at a compound annual growth rate of 25-30% for the next few years.   Written by Ajay Ramanathan  July 7, 2023 00:05 IST

   With asset quality concerns easing and loan demand sustaining, experts expect microfinance-focused non-banking financial companies to perform strongly in coming years. (IE) 
Satin Creditcare Network has plans to increase its retail micro, small and medium-sized enterprises portfolio to Rs 1,000 crore in the next two years from around Rs 250 crore currently, said its chairman and managing director HP Singh.
Following this, the microfinance loan company expects to grow its MSME book at a compound annual growth rate of 30-40%.
“The MSME segment is a very niche segment that we are trying to develop. We are only looking at the graduated microfinance customer to be given a higher ticket size loan,” Singh said.Also ReadAim to increase SME mix to 30%, says DBS Bank India EDSmall businesses not invincible to cyber security attacks; 48% suffered data breaches this yearSocial commerce emerging as a new model for small and medium businesses to transactThe story of how Instagram started and what entrepreneurs can learn from it

“Any customer that has done a couple of cycles with a microfinance institution is eligible for a higher ticket size loan along with a collateral that is there like rural house, any immovable property. That is the segment that we are looking at,” he added.
The company disburses MSME loans through its subsidiary Satin Finserv. Currently, the lender is disbursing MSME loans at a monthly run rate of Rs 15-20 crore. The ticket size of these loans ranges from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 10 crore.
Satin Creditcare had a consolidated assets under management of Rs 9,115 crore as on March 31 and expects to grow its overall loan book at a compound annual growth rate of 25-30% for the next few years.

Going ahead, Singh believes the acquisition of more customers in existing geographies, a 10-15% increase in ticket sizes to existing clients as well as an expansion into new geographies will drive the growth in the company’s loan book.
“Once the overhang of pandemic allayed, the income levels have started to come back, economy in the rural space has picked up, lockdown related challenges are now over. With an increase in economic activity and income levels, asset quality is much better now,” Singh said.
“Moving forward, our sense is that asset quality march will be positive for at least the next a few years given the manner in which economic activity has been shaping up,” he added.

   Apart from this, the propulsion module also has one scientific payload as a value addition which will be operated post separation of the lander module, it was noted.  
The Indian Space Research Organisation announced on Thursday that the Chandrayaan-3 mission is scheduled to be launched at 2.35 pm on July 14, with the lander expected to soft-land on the surface of the Moon on August 23 or 24.Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe landing and roving on the lunar surface.The Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft, which will be launched by LVM3 (Launch Vehicle Mark-III) (earlier referred as GSLV Mk III), is a composite of three modules — propulsion, lander, and rover (which is housed inside the lander).
“LVM3-M4/Chandrayaan-3 Mission:The launch is now scheduled for July 14, 2023, at 2:35 pm IST from SDSC, Sriharikota”, the national space agency headquartered here said in a tweet.Secretary of the Department of Space and ISRO Chairman Somanath S told reporters that the space agency would attempt soft-landing of the lander on August 23 or August 24.ISRO officials noted that the mission life of the lander is one lunar day, which is equal to 14 Earth days.”The date (for soft-landing) is decided based on when there is sunrise on the Moon. While landing, sunlight must be there. There is sunlight on the Moon for 14-15 days and for the next 14-15 days there is no sunlight,” they noted.

Chandrayaan-3 mission carries scientific instruments to study the thermo-physical properties of the lunar regolith, lunar seismicity, lunar surface plasma environment and elemental composition in the vicinity of the landing site.While the scope of these scientific instruments on the lander and the rover would fit in the theme of “Science of the Moon”, another experimental instrument will study the spectro-polarimetric signatures of the Earth from the lunar orbit, which would fit in the theme of “Science from the Moon”, according to ISRO officials.’.Also ReadISRO Chandrayaan-3 moon mission: India’s third lunar spacecraft integrated with launch vehicle International day of forests: Collaborative effort to help save our forestsISRO’s Chandrayaan 2: What went wrong with Vikram lander?

In March this year, the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft successfully completed the essential tests that validated its capability to withstand the harsh vibration and acoustic environment that the spacecraft would encounter during its launch.The propulsion module, which has Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) payload to study the spectral and polarimetric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit, will carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km of lunar orbit.Lander payloads are: ‘Chandra’s Surface Thermophysical Experiment’ to measure the thermal conductivity and temperature; ‘Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity’ for measuring the seismicity around the landing site; and ‘Langmuir Probe’ to estimate the plasma density and its variations.
A passive Laser Retroreflector Array from the US space agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), is also accommodated for lunar laser ranging studies.Rover payloads are: ‘Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer’ and ‘Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy’ for deriving the elemental composition in the vicinity of the landing site.The lander will have the capability to soft-land at a specified lunar site and deploy the rover which will carry out in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility.The main function of the propulsion module is to carry the lander module from launch vehicle injection till final lunar 100 km circular polar orbit and separate it. Apart from this, the propulsion module also has one scientific payload as a value addition which will be operated post separation of the lander module, it was noted.

GST Council to tighten registration rules; physical verification to be mandatory in ‘high risk’ cases
Also, the GST Rules are likely to be amended to state that person whose business premises is being verified should not be present at the spot during the physical verification.   Written by PTI  July 6, 2023 20:11 IST

   The central and state GST officers are currently undertaking a special drive to catch fake registration. 
In order to check fake registration, the GST Council is likely to reduce the time period to 30 days, from 45 days currently, for submission of PAN-linked bank account details of the person seeking registration with tax authorities.The Council, in its meeting on July 11, is likely to provide for mandatory physical verification of the business premises of “high risk” applicants before granting of GST registration.
Also, the GST Rules are likely to be amended to state that person whose business premises is being verified should not be present at the spot during the physical verification. The changes proposed by the Law Committee, comprising officers from Centre and states, with a view to contain fake registration under Goods and Services Tax (GST), would be considered by the Union finance minister-chaired GST Council.

The central and state GST officers are currently undertaking a special drive to catch fake registration. During the drive so far, 17,000 GSTINs were found to be non-existent. Of this, 11,015 GSTINs have been suspended and 4,972 have been cancelled, while Rs 15,000 crore tax evasion have been detected.Sources said in light of several cases of unscrupulous elements obtaining fake/ bogus GST registration, it is desirable to strengthen the process of registration under GST by amending provisions of Central GST Rules, wherever required.As per the existing GST Rules, a registered person is required to furnish details of PAN-linked bank account, which is in name of the registered person, within a period of 45 days from grant of registration or the date on which returns are due to be furnished, whichever is earlier.Also ReadL&T Construction bags significant EPC order for developing office space in MumbaiDMart hit by falling stock, intense offline and online competitionPast environmental issues: Vedanta’s plans to sell ESL Steel may get tepid responseAdani Wilmar’s Q1FY24 report: New launches that drove first quarter

The Law Committee suggested that the time period be reduced to 30 days from the date of outward supplies of goods or services in GSTR-1 or using invoice furnishing facility, whichever is earlier.In case of a proprietorship concern, the Permanent Account Number (PAN) of the proprietor shall also be linked with the Aadhaar number of the proprietor.In ‘high risk’ cases, the Law Committee suggested that the registration shall be granted within 30 days of application, after physical verification of the place of business.
The Committee was also of the opinion that the requirement of physical verification of business premises in the presence of the applicant poses “risk of manipulation by unscrupulous applicants making temporary arrangements in anticipation of the officer as well as risk of undue delays in case of wilful absence of the applicant”.Accordingly, the Committee recommended to the Council that the requirement of the presence of the applicant for physical verification of business premises may be done away with, sources said.A final decision on the recommendation of the Law Committee will be taken at the 50th GST Council meeting on Tuesday.

Air coolers are perhaps the most convenient way to keep your home or office cool during the scorching summers, at least in places with less humidity. With the advancement in technology, the modern air coolers have since replaced their more archaic predecessors. Take for instance, the i-breezio air cooler from Livpure, a sleek and stylish piece of equipment that is extremely portable, hence you can move it around, unlike in the earlier times when they had to be fixed near a window. It is Bluetooth and Wi-Fi-enabled, comes with lots of digital features and remote control, has a powerful air throw and delivers good circulation. Our trial unit was the 75 litre variant with a price tag of Rs 19,490, let us check out some of its key features.
Livpure i-breezio has a sleek design and features a touch control panel for speed and mode selection. You can even set run-time with a timer button. There’s a patented EGAPA filter, which ensures clean air and removes pollen, dust, smoke, and ammonia; it claims to kill viruses, bacteria, and fungus too. This cooler can effectively cover a decent-sized living room. It continuously senses the temperature and humidity of the room and when necessary, it activates the circulation pump, thereby delivering cooling with optimal water usage.

Earlier, at the June 23 Opposition meeting that was held in Patna, the RJD chief, known for his sense of humour and tongue-in-cheek remarks, gave a piece of paternal advice to Rahul Gandhi, saying his mother has been fretting over his indecision to get married, leaving all the Opposition leaders in splits.
“Rahul Gandhi didn’t follow my suggestion earlier. He should have married before. Abhi bhi time hai, shaadi kar lijiye (There is still time now, get married).”

The ageing septuagenarian went on to say, “Your mother (Sonia Gandhi) was saying that you do not listen to her and that we should get you married.”

According to Cointelegraph, Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange, has made plans for another upgradation of its wallet infrastructure. It is expected that they have also warned users about the change in their wallet address.
Sources revealed that on July 6, 2023, Binance officially announced that it would remove selected deposit addresses in batches as part of the shifting of the network address scheduled for quarter 3 (Q3) 2023, Cointelegraph added.
It is believed that Binance will send notifications to the users who had been affected. Also, Binance’s latest wallet upgrade may affect a total of about 40 cryptocurrencies. Supposedly, Binance encouraged all impacted account holders to get a new address and memo after receiving the notification, Cointelegraph highlighted.Also ReadBitcoin hits 13-month highAs cryptocurrency and digital assets see a rise in interest; is it time to make it to the willValkyrie is latest ETF issuer to refile Bitcoin fund application with SECCentralised exchanges saw a rise in cryptocurrency trading in June
